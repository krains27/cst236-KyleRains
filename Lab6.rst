What are the advantages and disadvantages of manual testing?
============================================================

The advantages are the person running the test may catch issues that wouldn't be seen by an 
automated test since an automated test usually focuses on specific areas. The disadvantages
is that the test needs to be run manually. It takes time for a person to sit down and run a
test. 

What are the advantages and disadvantages of automated testing?
===============================================================

The advantages are the tests can be run with little human interaction. Also, multiple tests
can be ran at once. The disadvantages are that they focus on specific areas of a system.
